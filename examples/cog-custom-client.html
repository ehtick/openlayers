shortdesc: Rendering a COG with a custom loader function.
docs: >
  Tiled data from a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) can be rendered as a layer.  In this
  example, a custom loader function is provided to handle requests with custom headers
  or authentication logic. The loader receives the URL, headers, and an abort signal,
  and must return a Response object.
